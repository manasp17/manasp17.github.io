        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>What is BMR?</strong> BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is the number of calories your body needs to perform basic functions at rest, such as breathing, digestion, and circulation.</li>
    <li><strong>Why is BMR important?</strong> BMR helps estimate how many calories you need to consume each day to maintain your current weight. It is a useful tool for weight management and understanding your caloric needs.</li>
    <li><strong>How do I calculate my BMR?</strong> You can calculate your BMR using personal information such as age, gender, weight, and height. This can be done using our BMR calculator on the website.</li>
    <li><strong>What factors affect BMR?</strong> Factors that can affect your BMR include age, gender, body composition, and genetics.</li>
    <li><strong>What is TDEE?</strong> TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories you burn in a day, considering your BMR and physical activity level.</li>
    <li><strong>How can I increase my BMR?</strong> Increasing physical activity, building muscle mass, and eating a balanced diet can help boost your BMR.</li>
    <li><strong>What is the difference between BMR and TDEE?</strong> BMR measures the calories needed for basic body functions at rest, while TDEE accounts for calories burned during physical activity and daily movements.</li>
    <li><strong>Can my BMR change over time?</strong> Yes, BMR can change due to factors such as age, weight loss or gain, muscle mass changes, and metabolic disorders.</li>
