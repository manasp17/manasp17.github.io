<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<h3>Application and Purpose:</h3>
<p>The Basal Metabolic Rate Calculator is a web application that allows users to calculate their BMR based on personal details. This BMR value will then be used to determine the number of calories needed to maintain, gain, or lose weight. The purpose of the site is to provide an easy-to-use tool that can help individuals understand their caloric needs based on their activity level and body data.</p>

<h3>Intended Users:</h3>
<p>The intended users are individuals who are interested in understanding their calorie needs for weight management. These users could include individuals interested in fitness, weight loss, or those trying to gain muscle mass.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Content:</h3>
<p>The website will consist of a homepage (with an introduction and the BMR calculator), informational pages about BMR, and results pages that provide insights based on the userâ€™s inputs. Users will also have access to a FAQ section about nutrition and BMR.</p>
